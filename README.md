# Gesture Controlled Mouse Pointer

This project provides a simple mouse controller driven by hand gestures.
It now relies on **MediaPipe** for robust hand landmark detection and a
lightweight CNN for gesture classification.

## Usage

Install requirements:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the controller:

```bash
python run.py --run
```
